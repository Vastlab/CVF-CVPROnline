# CVF-CVPROnline
Much of this is standard wordpress with a bunch of plugins but all the onese we used are here so we could setup new servers with git pull

most code in the subtheme  wp-content/themes/cvf-twentyseventeen-child/  but a few of the list-templates were customized in their directories since they did not support proper theme customization, but with copies in the theme.  E.g. the plugins/the-events-calendar-templates-and-shortcode/templates/list-template.php



Very rough code being developed by T. Boult and students of the VAST lab  to support CVPR2020 online.
Based on wordpress with various plugins (with their own licenses).
All the Boult/CVF code is BSD-3 license, and should cite.
This code is currently very  rough and not meant for easy reading but is public incase you want to use it.
